# TeamUp Cosplay

The premis of this project is to create a simple web application for organizing cosplay projects for yourself and for multiple people.  TeamUp Cosplay will allow you to add projects and costumes to help organize what you want to make.  With each costume you are able to upload photos for refrence, create tasks for each part and tagging photos for them as well.  Compaire your refrence pictures with photos of fabrics/materials to see which one you like best.  Add your friends to a project so they can join in and help you find and pick materials as well as keep track of how well your costume is coming.

# Why I'm making this Template

Because I would like to make an easy place to colaborate and consolodate images, refrence and discussion.
There is still quite a bit to do but I hope to do it slowly but surely.
