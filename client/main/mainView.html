  <h3> What is this?</h3>
  <p>RTS Chess is a simple single page web app to play chess.  But not any chess, RTS chess; or "Real Time Stratagy" chess.  Although most of the rulse of chess still apply the major diffrence is your not limited by how many moves you can make in a sinle turn.  With RTS chess you can move as many peices as you want, however every time you move a peices you have to wait a specific amount of time before you can move that same piece again so be carefull.</p>

  <p>With this system each peices has one of three classes which will determine their wait time.</p>

  <ul>Class 3 : Pawns and King  : 5 second</ul>
  <ul>Class 2 : Bishop, Knights, Rooks  : 5.5 second</ul>
  <ul>Class 1 : Queen/s  : 6 second</ul>

  <h3>Not a big deal?</h3>
  <p>Well, its not, as long as you remeber to be aware of the time.  If you use your queen to move into possition, your opponent can move his own pawn into strike possition immidiatly after.  Giving him a one second window to take your queen before you can do anything so be prepaired</p>

  <h3>Join or Watch</h3>
  <p>Want to join a game, its easy just hit the join a game button.  When you do you'll be matched up with another player waiting to play.  There might not be a lot of people playing right now so if you don't get matched up try again.  "COMING SOON"</p>
  <p>Eventualy I will add a button for making your own game and personaly inviting someone to join your game. But for now "COMING SOON"</p>
  <p>Want to watch a game rather then play? No problem, Click the "Watch game" button and it will randomly choose a current game to watch.  "COMING SOON"</p>

  <h3>Leaving a Game</h3>
  <p>If you close the page, or naviage to another page it will count as an automatic forfite.</p>

  <h3>Later plans</h3>
  <p>Depending on how gameplay feels time and other features might be adjusted.  Eventualy I might like the idea of "power ups" might be intersting.</p>
