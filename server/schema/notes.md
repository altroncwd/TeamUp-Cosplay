## Notes for myself on Mongo/Mongoose ##
## - Schema ##

    When we require our models elsewhere, we can save things a few ways.
    
    1). we create the var object with the models
```
        var dog = new Dog( {
            name : 'Oreo'
        });
        
    // then we have to save it
        
        dog.save(function(err, savedDog) {
            if (err) {
                next (err)
            } else {
                res.json(savedDog);
            }
        })
```        
    2). create the new model and save at the same time      (my prefered method)
```    
        Dog.create({name: 'Oreo'}, function (err, savedDog) {
            ^ same error handling as above
        })    
```    
    3).  ewww method 
```
        var dog = new Dog();
        dog.name = 'Oreo';
        dog.save(funciton(err, savedDog) {
            ^ same error handling as above
        })
```        
        
    Can use exports.__name__ for multpile schema if I dont want to break these schema up into separate files

```
    exports.projectMembers = mongoose.model('ProjectMembers', ProjectMembersSchema);
    exports.project = ...
    exports._______ = 
```



## - Query ##

when you require a schema , you can use that model to find things as well.

in one file you'd export your post.
```
    module.exports(mongoose.model('post', PostSchema)); 
```

in the file you use it require it.

```
var post = require ( filepath to the mongoose model );

post.find({ Search params, keys/values },   function(err, doc) {
    if (err) {
        next (err);
    }  else  {
        res.json(doc);
    }
}). then()
// typicaly return promises, and whats returned is an array of results.
```

there is a Find By Id method as well, _id's are generated by mongo when things are saved, lookup is direct so its more quick.
```
    Model.findById ( ' ID ', function (err, doc) { 
    
    })
```

Find and Update  (this method will repace everything with the passed in value, you'll esentialy be swapping objects 
```
    Model.findByIdAndUpdate ( '___id___', { key : '__new updated value__'}, function (err, updatedDoc) {
       ^ same error handling methods 
    });
```
There are other methods for updating values rather then replacing whole values outright.


there is a .populate method for joining objets together via refrences...
